## How does it work?
- Loads ```passwords.txt```
- Stores all passwords in a list
- Asks user for a SHA‑256 hash
- Hashes each password from the list
- Compares with the input hash
- If match found → shows original password
- If no match → prints “No matching passwords”
- Pauses at the end so window doesn’t close

### You can add your passwords in ```passwords.txt``` too.

### How to use?
There is ```input("\nPress Enter to exit...")``` so you can just dobule click the HashMatch.py to run it
